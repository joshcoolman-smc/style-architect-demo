const README_CONTENT = `# Design System Explorer

A modern web application for experimenting with and demonstrating design system fundamentals including color palettes, typography, and UI elements.

## 🤖 Built Entirely with AI-Driven Development

This entire application was created through **conversational AI development** using Anthropic's Claude large language model. Every line of code, component architecture, and feature implementation emerged from a collaborative dialogue between developer and AI. This represents a new paradigm in software development where natural language prompting and iterative conversation replace traditional coding workflows.

**No manual coding was involved** - the entire codebase is the result of structured prompts, architectural discussions, and iterative refinements through AI conversation. This demonstrates the power of modern AI development tools and collaborative human-AI workflows.

## 🏗️ Exceptional Architecture & Organization

This project showcases **enterprise-grade code organization** using a **feature module pattern** that promotes scalability, maintainability, and developer experience:

### Feature-Based Architecture
\`\`\`
src/
├── features/           # Feature modules with complete encapsulation
│   ├── colors/        # Color palette generation & management
│   │   ├── components/    # Feature-specific UI components
│   │   ├── hooks/         # Custom React hooks
│   │   ├── service/       # Business logic layer
│   │   ├── repository/    # Data access layer
│   │   ├── utils/         # Feature utilities
│   │   └── types/         # TypeScript definitions
│   ├── typography/    # Font systems & type scales
│   ├── elements/      # UI component demonstrations
│   └── fonts/         # Font selection & management
├── stores/            # Zustand state management with persistence
├── components/        # Shared UI components & layouts
└── pages/            # Route-based page components
\`\`\`

### Architectural Benefits
- **🎯 Domain-Driven Design**: Each feature is self-contained with its own components, logic, and types
- **🔄 Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, business logic, and data layers
- **📦 Modular Architecture**: Features can be easily extracted, tested, or modified independently
- **🚀 Scalability**: New features follow established patterns without architectural debt
- **🛠️ Developer Experience**: Intuitive file organization and clear dependency flows

## 🔥 Unique Features

### Built-in README Viewer
One of the most innovative aspects of this application is its **meta-feature**: a built-in markdown README viewer that renders this very documentation within the application itself. This creates a self-documenting application where users can understand the codebase and architecture without leaving the interface.

### Smart State Management
- **Persistent Design Choices**: Your color palettes and typography selections persist across navigation
- **Zustand Integration**: Lightweight, TypeScript-first state management
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes reflect immediately across all components

## What is this app for?

This tool is designed for designers, developers, and design enthusiasts who want to:

- **Experiment with color palettes**: Generate harmonious color schemes from uploaded images or explore curated sample palettes
- **Explore typography combinations**: Test different font pairings and type scales to find the perfect typographic hierarchy
- **Visualize design elements**: See how colors and typography work together in real UI components like cards, buttons, and layouts
- **Create style guides**: Develop and iterate on design systems with immediate visual feedback

Perfect for design exploration, client presentations, or building the foundation of your next project's visual identity.

## Features

- **🎨 Smart Color Palette Generation**: Upload any image to extract a 9-color palette, or cycle through curated sample images
- **📝 Typography System**: Experiment with different font combinations and type scales
- **🧩 Component Showcase**: See your design choices applied to real UI elements (cards, buttons, layouts)
- **💾 Persistent State**: Your design choices persist as you navigate between different sections
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices
- **📖 Self-Documenting**: Built-in README viewer for meta-documentation experience

## Development Philosophy

This project embodies several key development principles:

1. **AI-First Development**: Entire codebase generated through conversational AI
2. **Feature-Driven Architecture**: Domain-focused organization over technical layers
3. **Type Safety First**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage
4. **Component Composition**: Reusable, composable UI patterns
5. **Performance by Design**: Optimized bundles and minimal re-renders
6. **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and ARIA compliance throughout

## How it was created

This application was built using [Lovable](https://lovable.dev), an AI-powered web development platform, in collaboration with Anthropic's Claude large language model. The development process involved:

- **Conversational Architecture Design**: Discussing patterns and structure through natural language
- **Iterative Feature Development**: Building features through prompt-driven conversations
- **AI-Guided Refactoring**: Optimizing code organization through AI suggestions
- **Collaborative Problem Solving**: Working with AI to solve complex technical challenges

This represents a new paradigm where developers focus on problem definition and architectural thinking while AI handles implementation details.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (recommended: install with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating))
